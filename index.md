## 工作经历
### **Apple** `2022.5 - 2022.9`

_Research Intern - Machine Intelligence_<br>

### **Microsoft Research** `2020.5 - 2020.8`

_Research Intern_<br>
Worked with the [PROSE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/prose/) team (mentored by [Titus Barik](https://www.barik.net/)) on improving developer productivity in Visual Studio Code. I interviewed developers to elicit their needs for code transformation tools in editors. Inspired by the empirical data and relevant work in program synthesis, I designed **reCode**, an interaction model for rapidly performing complex code transformation using the familiar find-and-replace experience.

### **Carnegie Mellon University, Research Experiences for Undergraduate** `2017.5 - 2017.8`

_Research Assistant_<br>
**Penrose** is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics using two domain-specific languages: **Substance** and **Style**. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.

### **Columbia University, Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab** `2017.1 - 2017.5`

_Research Assistant_<br>
Worked with prof. Steven Feiner, on **Cyber Affordance Visualization in Augumented Reality** project. Developed a Microsoft Hololens application that visualizes the Columbia campus in AR environment.
